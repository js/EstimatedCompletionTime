A test project that implements two simple algorithms for estimating the time remaining of an opague task:

* *JKSEstimatedCompletionTime* Implements a simple, but effective, approach to estimating the time remaining
* *JKSEstimatedCompletionCalculator* Calculates the time remaining using a rolling average of the previous completion times
